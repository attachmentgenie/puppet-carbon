# carbon.conf - Managed by Puppet.
# Configure carbon directories.
#
# OS environment variables can be used to tell carbon where graphite is
# installed, where to read configuration from and where to write data.
#
#   GRAPHITE_ROOT        - Root directory of the graphite installation.
#                          Defaults to ../
#   GRAPHITE_CONF_DIR    - Configuration directory (where this file lives).
#                          Defaults to $GRAPHITE_ROOT/conf/
#   GRAPHITE_STORAGE_DIR - Storage directory for whipser/rrd/log/pid files.
#                          Defaults to $GRAPHITE_ROOT/storage/
#
# To change other directory paths, add settings to this file. The following
# configuration variables are available with these default values:
#
#   STORAGE_DIR    = $GRAPHITE_STORAGE_DIR
#   LOCAL_DATA_DIR = STORAGE_DIR/whisper/
#   WHITELISTS_DIR = STORAGE_DIR/lists/
#   CONF_DIR       = STORAGE_DIR/conf/
#   LOG_DIR        = STORAGE_DIR/log/
#   PID_DIR        = STORAGE_DIR/
#
# For FHS style directory structures, use:
#
#   STORAGE_DIR    = /var/lib/carbon/
#   CONF_DIR       = /etc/carbon/
#   LOG_DIR        = /var/log/carbon/
#   PID_DIR        = /var/run/
